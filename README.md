# Diabetes-prediction--Classification-
Develop a model with Jupyter Notebook which automates if a patient has diabetes or not 


We have some independent variables: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age.

Dependent variable : Outcome (1 : patient has diabetes, 0 : patient has no diabetes)

We will predict Outcome variable by using multiple classification models such as:

    Logistic Regression, 
    KNN, 
    SVM, 
    Artificial Neural Networks, 
    Decision Tree, 
    Random Forest, 
    Gradient Boosting, 
    XGBoost, 
    Light GBM,
    CatBoost.
We will use Cross validation for each model to get better predictions. Then we will compare RMSE values to decide which algorith works better.
